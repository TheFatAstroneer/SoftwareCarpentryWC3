# The Wandering Earth

‘The Wandering Earth’ is one small step for Chinese cinema, and one giant leap for sci-fi. The hit Chinese science fiction film “The Wandering Earth” dominated this year’s Lunar New Year box office, raking in over $296 million in less than a week. Audience reactions to the movie, which is based on a short story by Liu Cixin, have so far been largely positive, and the movie currently has a score **7.8/10** on IMDB.
